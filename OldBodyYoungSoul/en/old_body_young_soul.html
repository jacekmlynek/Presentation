<p>Generally example in Ruby and Javascript do the same thing - delegate some behaviours to new instances.  </p>

  <li>If we have duck typing and our client doesn’t care from who he get, but if or if not. So we really need class type?</li>
  <li>Module. Do we really need it to “augment” abstraction. In Ruby when we create object using class Module is necessary to place only abstraction. In Javascript we don’t need it because it doesn’t matter if we create new group of object or simple new instance. We do it in the same way. Besides we can use domain to augment abstraction. Simple name it Printable not Printer.    </li>

<ul>
  <li>Object Oriented Programing is about objects not classes.</li>
  <li>Classes are not only way to create objects.</li>
  <li>Classes inheritance can very easy break SRP and LSP.</li>
  <li>Delegation seems to be the right solution for “wrong inheritance” and SRP problems.</li>
  <li>In Ruby in Javascript delegation is natural and comes for free.</li>
  <li>
    <p>In Javascript is even easier because we don’t need additional abstractions such a classes or modules.</p>

    <pre><code>  After all Javascript like for old man seems to be very fresh. It also seems to be ideally language for domain driven maybe using DCI, who knows :).
